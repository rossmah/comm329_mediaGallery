# COMM329 Media Gallery
By Holly Rossmann

A page modelled for different plants and forest aspects. There are two main portions of the site - a carousel and a group of media cards. The carousel features different images that can be toggled by hitting either a forward or back arrow. Additionally, a particular image can be selected by clicking on the corresponding thumbnail. Each media card features and image and summary text, and can be further expanded by clicking on a "Learn More" button. This button triggers a modal to appear with more text.
